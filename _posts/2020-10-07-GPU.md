I received a sponsor from Nvidia and was invited to participate in a workshop "Fundamentals of 
Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++" in the GPU Technology Conference. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application 
programming interface model created by Nvidia. The workshop was very well-organised and I want to 
thank Nvidia for this generous offer. In the workshop, we covered the following three areas:

Accelerating Applications with CUDA C/C++

Managing Accelerated Application Memory with CUDA C/C++ Unified Memory and nsys

Asynchronous Streaming, and Visual Profiling for Accelerated Applications with CUDA C/C++
